### What I learned

While I am proficient in writing HTML & CSS, I wanted to explore manipulating more Bootstrap in this challenge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
I was able to play with this Bootstrap property to maninpute what would act as
the footer. class="row position-absolute bottom-0 start-50 translate-middle-x">
```

```css
I
  also
  noticed
  the
  padding
  I
  added
  needed
  to
  be
  more
  responsive
  so
  I
  needed
  to
  added
  some
  @media
  properties
  @media
  (max-width: 900px) {
  .body-text {
    padding: 0;
  }
}
```
